### Visulazing the History of Nobel Prize Winner

The Nobel Foundation has made a dataset available of all prize winners from the outset of the awards from 1901 to 2023. The dataset used in this project is from the Nobel Prize API and is available in the nobel.csv file in the data folder.

In this project, I explored and answered several questions related to this prizewinning data.
* What is the most commonly awarded gender and birth country?
* Which decade had the highest ratio of US-born Nobel Prize winners to total winners in all categories?
* Which decade and Nobel Prize category combination had the highest proportion of female laureates?
* Who was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize, and in what category?
* Which individuals or organizations have won more than one Nobel Prize throughout the years?
